Notes:
Works on Playlist Pages: This script only works on YouTube playlist pages, where the video elements are structured in a specific way.
Pagination: If the playlist has multiple pages, this code will only fetch videos from the current visible page. You might need to scroll down to load more videos if the playlist is long.
Cross-Browser: This code should work in most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
